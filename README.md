#tree.py

When pressing 'tree.py' in the command line, there will appear the folders and files on the directory the user is currently in, without having to find the directory he is in by himself when he presses 'tree'

Requirements for it to work just by pressing 'tree.py':
  Open command line and type:
    sudo cp <the directory the tree.py file is in> /usr/local/bin
    cd /usr/local/bin
    chmod +x tree.py 

Current features:
  -can also show hidden files by pressing 'tree.py -a'

Currently working on adding new features...
